Port of the [Zenburn](http://slinky.imukuppi.org/zenburnpage/) low-contrast color scheme to IntelliJ Idea.  It looks great with the new Darcula Theme in Idea 12!

To install, clone this repository and run

    sh buildJar.sh

This will create a settings.jar locally.  Within IntelliJ Idea's menu, choose "Import Settings" and select this .jar file.
